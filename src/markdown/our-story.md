## Work wherever and whenever you want, worry-free.

With Lanza, you decide how and when you work. Whether you want to earn some extra money for a night out in Amsterdam or take on a project during a weekend in Rotterdam, you can arrange it with just one click through our website or app. Choose flexibility and freedom in your life with Lanza!

## What do you want?

Many young people struggle to balance study, work, and personal life, and the lack of a clear vision for the future makes it even more challenging. Freelancing offers the perfect solution: you determine your own schedule and choose where and when you work. Plus, you can try something new every day—work as a barista in hospitality today and as an order picker in a warehouse tomorrow. Flexibility, freedom, and variety are within your reach!

## What can you expect from us?

**Flexibility is the key to success as a freelancer.**  
Companies choose freelancers who are motivated and responsible for their own work without being bound to the freelancer.

### Work = Pay

Financial security is crucial, especially for freelancers. The biggest concern is often not being paid (on time), which can lead to losses in the worst-case scenario. With us, you don’t have to worry about that. For just a small percentage of your invoice amount, we guarantee your earnings will be in your account within 3 business days. This way, you can focus entirely on your work without financial stress!

Companies using our platform work with verified and reliable freelancers, rated by other clients. Do you want to offer payment terms of 14, 30, or even 60 days as a company? No problem! We ensure that the freelancer maintains their cash flow and has immediate access to their earnings. This allows them to cover their expenses worry-free and continue their projects while you benefit from a flexible payment arrangement.

## Discover Yourself
