## FREELANCER TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Welcome to Lanza! We're excited that you want to get started as a Freelancer. As a Freelancer, you are an independent, self-employed contractor who has the freedom to decide how, where, when, for whom, and at what rate you work. Below are the terms and conditions that apply between Lanza and you as a Freelancer when using the Lanza platform. Please read them carefully, as by using the Lanza platform, you agree to abide by these terms. These terms and conditions may be updated periodically. We will inform you of any changes and ask for your consent. The most current version of the terms and conditions is always available on the Lanza Platform.

## 1. Who is Lanza?
Lanza is Lanza Jobs B.V., with its registered office at Kaldenkerkerweg 20, 5913 AE in Venlo, The Netherlands. Lanza is registered with KvK under number 94324328.  
We are a tech company that provides Freelancers and clients with an online platform, supported by advanced tools, where they can connect to arrange for the performance of shift-based assignments.

## 2. How does Lanza work?
If connected clients require services, they can post a 'shift' on the Lanza platform. Freelancers can then respond to the shift and negotiate with the client on the terms and conditions under which they, as a Freelancer, will collaborate.  
Once the client and the Freelancer have agreed on the terms, they will enter into a contract with each other. The platform provides a template for this contract, which is automatically filled in based on the agreements made between you and the client. This is very convenient! However, it’s important to note that Lanza is not a party to this agreement and only facilitates contact between you and the client. As a result, you and the client are free to modify our template as needed (see Article 9 of these terms).

## 3. What is Lanza's role?
Lanza ensures that Freelancers and clients can find each other and facilitates the execution of the assignment through the platform. That’s all. This means that Lanza – among other things – does not manage or provide instructions to you as a Freelancer, does not monitor or evaluate the execution of your assignment, does not pay a fee, and does not determine how, when, or by whom the work is performed. These are matters that you agree upon with the client. Additionally, we have no objection to you carrying out similar work via or for other platforms that may be seen as competitors of Lanza.

## 4. What is the role of the Freelancer?
As a Freelancer, you are an independent self-employed entrepreneur and contractor. Therefore, you are responsible for arranging assignments and making agreements with clients. Lanza does, of course, assist you with this.  
It is your responsibility to operate as a true entrepreneur. This includes, among other things, having multiple clients (and therefore variable income), determining how you or your replacement will carry out the work, and complying with all rules applicable to entrepreneurs. Of course, this also means you have the right to choose not to respond to any shift and thus are not obligated to do any work via the Platform.  
Being an entrepreneur also means taking on risks. For example, you are liable for any damage you cause. Additionally, if you are unable to work for any reason, you will have no income. Fortunately, many of these risks are covered through our partner, Alicia Benefits. However, if a client fails to pay or does not pay on time, it will be your responsibility, including any associated costs. Furthermore, you must ensure you save for your retirement, set aside money to pay income tax, and check if you are required to pay VAT (and comply with those obligations).  
Although Lanza can assist you with these matters and provide information, they remain your personal responsibility.

## 5. What is the meaning of certain terms?
In these terms and conditions, the terms listed below have the following meanings:

- **'You' or 'Freelancer'**: The independent entrepreneur and/or contractor who, using the Platform, enters into an Assignment with the Client to perform a Shift.
- **'Shift'**: The work posted by the Client on Lanza for which the Client is seeking one or more contractors to perform.
- **'Assignment'**: The assignment agreement established between the Freelancer (as the assignee) and the Client for the performance of the Shift.
- **'Client'**: The client of the Freelancer.
- **'Assignment Claims'**: The claims of the Freelancer against the Client for payment of fees for the Shift performed by the Freelancer.
- **'Platform'**: The digital platform maintained and operated by Lanza IP B.V. that connects Clients and Freelancers.
- **'Profile'**: The personal page of the Freelancer on the Platform.

## 6. What does Lanza do?
### 6.1 Lanza:
- Maintains the Platform;
- Grants the Freelancer the right to use the Platform and to create a Profile on it;
- Enables the Freelancer to respond to Shifts by using the Platform and as a result to come into contact with potential or actual Clients;
- Provides the Client and Freelancer with a template for the Assignment (which may be used at the Client's own discretion);
- Puts the Freelancer – if so desired by the Freelancer or Client – in contact with a party who helps with the financial settlement of the Assignment Claims;
- Collects, if requested by the Client, on behalf of the Client the No-Show fee if this is part of the agreements between the Freelancer and the Client (this collection may be carried out by Lanza group company, Lanza Jobs B.V., with its registered office in the Netherlands at Kaldenkerkerweg 20 (5913 AE) Venlo and registered at the Dutch Chamber of Commerce under number 94324328).

## 7. Your Profile
### 7.1 
Your profile is your calling card as a Freelancer. We have collected tips on this page to help you make your Profile as attractive as possible.  
### 7.2 
The Freelancer is solely responsible for what is written on their Profile. The information in your Profile must be correct, complete, truthful, and not in violation of any laws or regulations. The information may never be misleading, insulting, discriminatory, or otherwise unlawful or unnecessarily offensive.  
### 7.3 
Lanza is in no way liable for the content of your Profile.  
### 7.4 
Lanza always assumes that the person communicating through the Platform is the legal representative of the Freelancer.

## 8. You as a Freelancer
### 8.1 
Freelancers guarantee that they are independent contractors and comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including meeting the independence criteria for entrepreneurs and being entitled to provide services in the United Kingdom as independent self-employed contractors.  
### 8.2 
Lanza assists Freelancers with the following aspects of their business:  
As an independent contractor, you must have multiple Clients. Lanza helps the Freelancer monitor this by registering the hours worked for each Client.  
Example contract for services. More information on this can be found in Article 10.1 of these terms and conditions.  
We will be happy to assist you with any questions you may have about your business.  
### 8.3 
Although we assist you where possible, you are fully responsible for all legal and tax aspects of your business, including reporting your turnover and ensuring VAT is reported and paid on time.

## 9. The Assignment
### 9.1 
If the Freelancer is going to perform a Shift using the Platform, Lanza provides a template for the assignment (the Assignment Agreement). This contains a first draft of the terms that may apply between you as a Freelancer and the Client. As a self-employed contractor, the Freelancer is free to modify and/or supplement these terms together with the Client.  
Although you and the Client can determine which terms and conditions apply, it is recommended that at least the 'characteristic provisions' of Lanza’s template Assignment Agreement be included in the assignment terms to safeguard the self-employed status of the Freelancer. Additionally, it is essential that you and the Client adhere to the agreements set out in the Assignment.  
### 9.2 
After completing a Shift, you will want to be paid for the services you have provided. You can use the Platform to send your own invoices. You may choose to wait for the Client to pay or sell your claim (for a small fee) to a factoring company. The factoring company then pays you immediately and assumes the debtor risk.  
Note that Lanza is not a party to the agreement you enter into with the factoring company (just as Lanza is not a party to your agreement with a Client), and it is your responsibility whether or not to involve a factoring company. Lanza does provide the necessary data to enable invoice collection and claim purchase.  
### 9.3 
The Platform allows the Client and the Freelancer to rate each other. These ratings are displayed on the Profile of both the Client and the Freelancer. Lanza is not involved in this rating process and is not responsible for it.

## 10. Hours
### 10.1 
The Platform allows the Freelancer to log the hours worked for the Assignment. The Freelancer is responsible for ensuring these hours are entered correctly, completely, and on time within seven (7) days of completing a Shift. After the Freelancer has entered the hours, the Client has seven (7) days to either validate the hours or propose a counter-response. This seven (7) day response period also applies to any follow-up proposals or counter-proposals made by either the Client or the Freelancer.
### 10.2 
The recorded hours become final (i) once they have been validated by the Client (or the Freelancer, in the case of a counter-proposal), or (ii) after the seven-day period expires without the Client (or the Freelancer, in the case of a counter-proposal) either validating or disputing the recorded hours.

## 11. Guarantees and liability
### 11.1 
Lanza operates the Platform and ensures its proper functioning. However, all information on the Platform regarding Clients, Shifts, Freelancers, Assignments, etc., comes from the Freelancer, Clients, or other third parties. These parties are responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the information, not Lanza. Therefore, Lanza cannot be held liable for inaccurate or incomplete information.  
### 11.2 
Nothing on the Platform or the services/support provided by Lanza can be construed as an implicit or explicit guarantee, advice, promise, judgment of suitability, or otherwise. Lanza accepts no liability for damage caused by inaccurate or incomplete information or the use of documents/information provided by Lanza.  
### 11.3 
Lanza facilitates contact between the Freelancer and a potential or actual Client, but is not responsible for the actions or omissions of the Freelancer, Client, or other third parties that Lanza brings into contact with each other. Lanza accepts no liability for damage arising from the actions or omissions of these parties.  
### 11.4 
To the extent permitted by law, Lanza is not liable for any damage suffered by the Freelancer, regardless of the type of damage (whether direct or indirect), arising from or related to the performance of the Shift or the Assignment.

### 11.5
The Freelancer indemnifies Lanza and keeps Lanza indemnified against any liability, loss, damage, costs, and expenses of any kind arising from, or in connection with, claims by third parties, for any reason, as a result of the actions or omissions of the Freelancer.

## 12. Use of the Platform

### 12.1 
The Freelancer can start using the Platform as soon as their Profile is registered.

### 12.2
As a Freelancer, you have the option to assign all your existing and future receivables to the factoring company Svea Finans Nederland B.V., registered with the KvK under number 24334160, with its registered office at Reeuwijkse Poort 216, 2811 MZ, Reeuwijk, The Netherlands ("Svea"). You hereby authorize Lanza to act on your behalf, entering into a receivables purchase agreement with Svea (which Svea offers through our platform and which is attached to this user agreement as Annex 1). In this agreement, Svea’s terms and conditions are set forth, and you sell and assign all your receivables to Svea via the Platform. Svea will pay you according to the Client's standard payment terms or – if possible and subject to a small discount – within two business days after checkout (you can choose this option on the Platform).

### 12.3 
Both the Freelancer and Lanza have the right to terminate the use of the Platform without notice, without the obligation to pay compensation for any damages. Termination occurs through the removal of the Profile.

### 12.4 
Lanza has the right to refuse or suspend the registration – and thus the use of the Platform – of any candidate or registered Freelancer, should there be valid reasons, such as improper use of the Platform (for example, but not limited to, fraud).

### 12.5 
Terminating the use of the Platform means that the Freelancer can no longer acquire new Assignments via the Platform. However, this termination does not affect current Assignments, and all agreements related to those Assignments remain in effect until the time of termination.

### 12.6 
The Platform is to be used only for the purpose for which access is granted, including communication with potential or actual Clients regarding Assignments. The Freelancer is allowed to use the Platform solely for their own business purposes and may not provide access to third parties in any way.

### 12.7 
When using the Platform, the Freelancer must adhere to the applicable laws and regulations, these terms and conditions, as well as any procedures and instructions provided on the Platform.

### 12.8 
The Platform is designed for use by natural persons. It is not permitted to have the Platform accessed or used by automated systems, or to create a link between the Platform and an automated system without Lanza’s prior written consent.

### 12.9 
The login details for access to and use of the Platform are personal and must be kept confidential. The Freelancer is responsible for any use or misuse of these login details.

### 12.10 
Lanza takes all reasonable steps to ensure maximum availability and quality of the Platform. However, Lanza cannot guarantee continuous, error-free availability and correct operation.

### 12.11 
Lanza may temporarily suspend the availability of the Platform if needed for changes, or for preventive and/or corrective maintenance. Any inconvenience for the Freelancer will be kept to a minimum.

### 12.12 
Although Lanza has taken care in compiling the information on the Platform, it cannot guarantee its accuracy or completeness, as Lanza is dependent on third parties, processes, and technology for this.

---

## 13. Applicable Law and Court with Jurisdiction

### 13.1 
All legal relationships between Lanza and the Freelancer are exclusively governed by Dutch law.

### 13.2 
Any disputes related to or arising from these terms and conditions and/or any other legal relationship between Lanza and the Freelancer will be exclusively submitted to the competent Dutch court.
